# QuidIn-Day-trading-software
I designed and developed this software in 2019 before the COVID pandemic.<br>
It used to communicate with a NodeJs server for authentication and piping Intrinio real-time and historical data on the US Stock market and was able to carry out financial asset management and PL analysis.<br> 
An ML algorithm was implemented there for forecasting the candles. <br> 
Its efficiencies would be strengthened in the long term while this video is just a short clip.<br>

<h3>Keywords:</h3> 
C#, .NET, Web Socket, multi-threading, UI/UX design, SQL, REST, algo-trading, asset management <br>
