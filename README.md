# QuidIn-Day-trading-software-C#
I designed and developed this software in Oct 2019 before the COVID pandemic.<br>
It used to communicate with a NodeJs server for authentication, marshalling and transferring Intrinio real-time and historical data on the US Stock market and was able to carry out financial asset management and PL analysis shortly.<br> 
An ML algorithm was implemented there for forecasting the candles. <br> 

## Statement of the problem
Investing and trading used to be a profession. You could either be a fundamentalist who would research the company to answer the simple question or a day trader who has some skills and special tools. If the money flow is healthy then we may try some systematic or technical trades.<br>
If the price of the company is following one direction (see for example [1](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6782784)), there are chances that it will keep on doing the same if nothing changes. Hence forecasting the time series would be possible. However, this stereotype has changed over and over again in the past two decades.<br>
1 out of 634 people in the world trade online and online trading may be the new pastime of choice for millennials worldwide. Unfortunately, the sad truth is that the new trader is not equipped to find success in the markets and over 90% of retail day traders will lose money. For example; 75% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider [2](https://www.strategystocks.co.uk/contracts-for-difference.html]).

## Solution
Fundamental-based software is one of the existing tools. Usually, their information dates for the time the fillings were released, which can be several months. Another existing tool is advanced technical analysis tools which provide lagging information by a few minutes to a few seconds. QuidIn has been developed to support an on-the-fly type software with tries to convey information to the user as fast as it can be. However, the provided data is minimal. Metrics for comparing existing tools are their costs (price per month) and the number of subscribers.<br> 
Additionally, QuidIn provides lagging indicators and ML-based leading indicator as an additional service.

QuidIn has a tutirial service (multimedia) which allow a day-trader to effectively use this software and have the maximum benefit of it. It also provides services such as watchlist, multi-chart view, advanced dashboard, social media BuzzFeed, customizing the chart view and enabling special menu on each chart.<br>
